Short documentation:
This short app creates 2 distribtuions: normal with different degree of freedom and distribution with different mean.
You can use sliders to change distribution parameters:
1) Degree of Freedom: the number of values in a study that are free to vary. The greater number the closer distribution to Normal
2) Number of observation
3) Value's range: the range of values from which they have been picked
4) Mean: set up the mean of distribution<p>")
